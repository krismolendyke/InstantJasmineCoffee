# Instant Jasmine Coffee

*A [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/ "CoffeeScript") skeleton project for test-driving with [Jasmine BDD](https://jasmine.github.io/ "Jasmine: BDD for Javascript | Jasmine")*

## Requirements
Based on the change to module management in [`npm` v1.0+](http://blog.nodejs.org/2011/03/23/npm-1-0-global-vs-local-installation/ "npm 1.0: Global vs Local installation &laquo; node blog"), the following modules are now local to this project:

* [coffee-script](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script)
* [uglify-js](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS)
* [growl](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-growl), which requires [growlnotify](http://growl.info/extras.php#growlnotify "Growl - Extras") to be available on your `PATH`

You shouldn't have to install them with `npm`.  If you're not running OS X, or don't have Growl available, you obviously won't see any pretty notifications.  But it should be trivial to replace that function with your OS specific variant if you'd like to.

## Usage

From project root:

    cake watch:all

That's it.  Hack away and run your test suite with `SpecRunner.html`.  There are several other tasks in `Cakefile` that you can checkout in the source, or simply execute:

    cake

for a few short descriptions.

## More Info

I've written a couple of posts about this skeleton project where you can learn more about why and how you can make use of it.
